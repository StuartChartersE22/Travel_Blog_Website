# Travel Blog Website

This is a full stack web blogging app using Java for the logic and data processing, Hibernate for database querying and persistance, and Velocity/Spark for web browser formatting. The project was in conjunction with another student utalising the collaborative power of GitHub for remote working as well as local pair programming.

Future work:
Admin side site needs styling more extensively, at the moment it has a basic format which is largely readable although certain display data needs to be labeled or made more explicit. Visitors side has better formatting with more consistant styling and better layout. Need to add functionality to remove tags and categories, as well as the implamentation of a log in system. Java code and database are already designed with the functionality just needs to be implamented.
